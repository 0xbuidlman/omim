Transformation shader for lines.

Attributes:
- position (vec4) x, y, z, 1
- direction (vec4) Tx, Ty, lineHalfWidth

To use this vertex shader you must format vertex data by this rule:
  when we draw line we must create 2 triangle on one line segment but 2 vertex that produced by one line point
  (vertex + halfWidthNormalVector). must be equal. Width will be computed in this shader.
  For example we have one segment line { A = (0, 0), B = (10, 10) }
  thiangles must be [ A, A, B, B].
  Direction is the vector for normal calculate, and direction for upper "A" must be opposite for direction for bottom "A"
                                    [B - A, A - B, B - A, A - B]
  In this case we can mul direction on modelView separate from position and get line rotation in pixel coordinate,
  format normal and create a width of line
