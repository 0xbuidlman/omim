/*
 * These tests are developed to simplify routing integration tests writing.
 * You can use the interface bellow however you want but there are some hints.
 * 1. Most likely you want to use GetAllMaps() to get shared_ptr<OsrmRouterComponents>.
 *    It loads all the maps from directories Platform::WritableDir()
 *    and Platform::ResourcesDir() only once and then reuse it.
 *    Use LoadMaps() only if you want to test something on a special map set.
 * 2. Loading maps and calculating routes is a time consumption process.
 *    Do this only if you really need it.
 * 3. If you want to check that a turn is absent you have two options
 *    - use GetTurnByPoint(...).TestNotValid();
 *    - or use TestTurnCount.
 * 4. The easiest way to gather all the information for writing an integration test is
 *    - to put a break point in OsrmRouter::CalculateRouteImpl;
 *    - to make a route with MapWithMe desktop application;
 *    - to get all necessary parameters and result of the route calculation;
 *    - to place them into the test you're writing.
 * 5. The recommended way for naming tests for a route from one place to another one is
 *    <Country><City><Street1><House1><Street2><House2><Test time. TurnTest or RouteTest for the time being>
 * 6. It's a good idea to use short routes for testing turns. The thing is geometry of long routes
 *    could be changes for one dataset (osrm version) to another one.
 *    The shorter route the less chance it'll be changed.
